### Solo - Section 002

Upon recieving the application idea for the current project we 
immedately went to work on splitting it into user stories. Our 
method here was simple: divide and conquer. Each of us claimed 
about one quarter of the description from the customer and began.
We titled and described features according to standard methods 
of this procedure. There are four main sections of each user 
story on a note card: title, description, estimate, and priority. They will be described in order of appearance.  

If the details of the basic construction of a user story is 
familiar to the reader, he or she may skip to the section labeled 
**User Stories**. This is where the details of current projects 
user stories are contained. 

### Title

The title of each user story is meant to be a short description 
of an action that a user of the software should be able to do. 
Specifically, it should have an active wording. After a title of 
a feature was created on a note card it was immediately described
by the following method.

### Description

The description of the user story is meant to describe the core 
functionality of a single feature. It is not meant to contain 
wording which would suggest it can be split into multiple user 
stories. Some examples of this phrasing would be 'also' or 'and.'
In addition to this, a description is not meant to describe any 
details about the process of implementation including but not 
limited to programming language, backend or front end 
implementation details, etc. It may (should) contain details 
about design or specific functionality, if the user desires a 
certain appearance (appearance applicable). Upon completion of 
a description for each user story, all cards were compiled for 
to collectively determine estimates via the following method.

### Estimate

The estimate of each user story is meant to describe the number 
of working days expected to complete an entire user story. These 
estimates were first described in a round of planning poker. A 
'game' meant to help everyone speak up about their assumptions 
on a particular user story. This is where actual development 
ideas can be introduced. Often times people will disagree on the 
number of days required to complete a user story and this is the 
time to iron out many of the details and requirements and to 
expell assumptions so everyone is on the same page. A round of 
planning poker is played as follows:

1. Each player takes a set of cards marked with varying numbers 
   along the lines of 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... , 50, 100, ?;
2. A user story is laid out so that everyone involved can read it;
3. Each player chooses an estimate from his or her hand and 
   places it face down on the table in front of them. A few notes 
   should be made here. Namely, the 50 and 100 cards are generaly 
   used if a person does not know exactly how to estimate a user 
   story or everything that would need to be included. A ? card 
   may be used if a person does not understand what a certain 
   user story may require to implement and would like more 
   information from the other people on the project;
4. Once everyone has laid down an estimate, all are flipped 
   simultaneously. Each person will then have a chance to express 
   any assumptions or concerns about the user story in question.
   These will then be discussed and written down. Note: even if 
   everyone has the same estimate, the details of it should still 
   be discussed among everyone;
5. An estimate is agreed upon by everyone there and is recorded 
   on the bottom of the notecard that the user story resides on. 
   Note: another round of planning poker should be played to 
   confirm that there are no more assumptions from others. As 
   previously mentioned, any notes about assumptions should be 
   kept on another sheet of paper and properly organized; 
6. Steps 2-5 are repeated for every user story. 

If it has not been done already, the customer is to set 
priorities on each of the user stories that has been made. 

### Priority

It should be noted here that, at the time of writing this, we 
have not obtained priorities for any of the user stories. 
However, when a priority is to be set, dependencies of certain 
features must be explained to the customer. Priorities are to 
be given one of the values 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60. These are to 
be initially given as the multiples of 10 listed where 10 is a 
top priority and 50 is next to last. The priority 60 is reserved 
for user stories that are not currently important, but may be a 
future addition in another version. It should be noted that these 
stories should not be discarded, as they are still features 
requested by the customer.

### User Stories

Now that the general procedure has been described, we may now 
delve into the actual creation of the user stories for this 
project.
